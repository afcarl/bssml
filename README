This repository contains Matlab implementations of the algorithms proposed in "Coupled Dimensionality Reduction and Classification for Supervised and Semi-Supervised Multilabel Learning", which is appearing in Pattern Recognition Letters, and "Bayesian Supervised Multilabel Learning with Coupled Embedding and Classification", which is appearing in the Proceedings of the 12th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM 2012).

demo_supervised.m file shows how to use the algorithm for supervised learning.
demo_semisupervised.m file shows how to use the algorithm for semi-supervised learning.
